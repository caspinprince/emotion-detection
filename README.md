# emotion-detection
The goal of this project is to predict the emotion of a text message using an ML model. 
The model was trained using data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp)
and currently performs with 90% accuracy. The model is saved in the .pkl file and can be deployed as an API 
using api.py. The end goal is to create a practical product by implementing this API in a web app.
